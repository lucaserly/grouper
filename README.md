### Built with
- [React Native & Expo](https://reactnative.dev)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

### Tested with 
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

### Observations

- I was given this project with the goal to implement testing
- The main objective was to test the core functionality of the app from the user's perspective
- I was not able to trigger the PanResponder through the fireEvent API. Apparently the onResponderGrant resets the parameter gestureState being passed to default values
- Therefore, I proceeded with unit testing
