### Built with
- [React Native & Expo](https://reactnative.dev)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)

### Tested with 
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

### Observations

- I was given this project with the goal to implement testing.
- The main objective was to test the core functionality of the app from the user's perspective.
- I was not able to trigger the panresponder through the fireEvent API. Apparently the onResponderGrant resets the parameter gestureState being passed to default values.
